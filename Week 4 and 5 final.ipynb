I will spend hours deciding which area in a city I will visit because of how tedious it is planning my commute between desired attractions. My solution to this problem is to create a tool using the location data on Foursquare that will allow customers to input their desired attractions (ex. resturants, movies, sports). This tool will optimize the customers experience while visiting the city by recommending neighborhoods in the desired city with the maximum density of requested attractions. This will save the customer time and gurantee an excepional experience while visiting their city of choice. For this project, I will be exploring the city of Pittsburgh, PA."

Similar to the New York and Toronto examples, I will be retrieving information on the density of different attractions in a given neighborhood. I will create a tool that will filter columns to be used in calculating which neighborhoods should be recommended. For example, if the user inputs 'resturants' and 'parks' as search criteria, the tool will filter only those columns and add up their densities. The new column with the summation of the densities will be sorted in descending order and the top three neighborhood will be suggested as recommended places to visit. "
